Let's try observation space like this now:
Use CNN with PPO!
NxN matrices for each feature

Give minus reward for a bad move


What features to choose (NxN feature maps):
    1) isEnemyBuilding
    3) isEnemyTroop
    2) Health
    3) Power
    4) canMove
    5) Unit to move




POWER IS DECREASED FOR MISSING HEALTH AND THERE ARE OTHER DEBUFFS..
MAKE VARIABLES WITH DEBUFFS AND WHEN THEY DISAPPEAR
Do I have to make the human be able to make moves?

When attacking the player can only move there if the unit is killed, otherwise stay in the same place 
Also if attacking from 2 tiles we should move the player one tile closer and only then attack, might be a little difficult to make
Or just w

Finish the game when all the troops die? sure

If you stay in the same place, remove all movement.
Otherwise remove movement however much you moved.

AI just walked through the city, get_reachable_pos doesn't work correctly

I want to already mask what is possible and what is not (not allow to make invalid moves)

no masking ,just return a large negative reward if invalid action
