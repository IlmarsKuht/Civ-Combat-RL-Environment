HIGH PRIORITY:


MEDIUM PRIORITY:
Only remove movement however much used

Probably I can just use a 1D array for observations
Return unprocessed observations so the user can do whatever they want
Different Terrain
Terrain, Health, combat etc. buffs and DEBUFFS
train a model and put it as the enemy
Probably move the render functions somewhere else?
Make troop and building have the same parent class (x, y, health ,power) etc.. and then inherit
add healing when fortified
Just go through the wiki and add everything about combat 
Add unit training
If I add more cities, I need to change so my game doesn't stop when a city is destroyed

What debuffs do cities suffer from

Prallelize training of model iwth vector env? (check how to do it)


LOW PRIORITY:

Why Box obs doesn't accept some shapes? (I guess doesn't except not perfect square)
Make the code better
a lot of the functions should be made private.
Modify the grid search functions, try to combine them?
