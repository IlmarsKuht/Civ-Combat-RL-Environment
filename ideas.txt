HIGH PRIORITY:
Give them a little more power, they barely killing the city
CHECK IF ALL OF THE CHANNELS ARE CORRECT, ESPECIALLY CAN_MOVE, MASK WAS VERY WEIRD AND ONLY HAD 1 MOVE FOR A LONG TIME
ASK CHATGPT HOW TO GET RID OF ALL THE IF STATEMENTS AND IMPROVE MY CODE AND COMBINE MY CODE
COMBINE THE THREE GRID SEARCH FUNCTIONS OR MAKE THEM EASEIR, THEY ARE STUPIDLY COMPLEX AND REPETITIVE
Do some rendering so that we can know a troop is in the building
at the very start mask is all 0s, why?
Check reward scaling and discount rate (said they should be similar or smth)

Let players make their own moves (ACTUALLY WOULD BE VERY GOOD FOR DEBUGGING)


MEDIUM PRIORITY:
Different Terrain
Terrain, Health, combat etc. buffs and DEBUFFS
a lot of the functions should be made private.
City centers also should be able to attack
Modify the grid search functions, try to combine them?
Probably move the render functions somewhere else?
Make troop and building have the same parent class (x, y, health ,power) etc.. and then inherit
add healing when fortified and maybe a reward for healing? How to encourage AI to heal, he might not find how to do it
Group damage bonus
Just go through the wiki and add everything about combat 
Add unit training
If I add more cities, I need to change so my game doesn't stop when a city is destroyed

What debuffs do cities suffer from

Prallelize training of model iwth vector env? (check how to do it)

SHould agent be punished for the game ending


LOW PRIORITY:



Remove movement however much you moved. (NON-priority because useless since AI can see the entire map)

Why Box obs doesn't accept some shapes? (I guess doesn't except not perfect square)


When is a tile not reachable

1) obstacle
2) any Troop
3) Enemy buildings
