WORKING NOW:


HIGH PRIORITY:

ADD UNIT TESTS to test observation and edge cases (out of map, no moves, etc...)
The unit test should be made so that future changes don't break it (test things that should always be the same)

MEDIUM PRIORITY:
If a player has no more cities, he should be removed from the game (all troops killed and everything removed)
robably need to rethink the rewards. Maybe reward for damage dealt/taken not just attacking
Putting a minus default reward is kind of weird because of how the system is set up, the player will get rewarded
for AI making default moves. Probably I should set up different rewards for player and bot? Maybe bot rewards are less,
so the player focuses on his own strategy not on predicting what the bot does so much

Document my code how it was documented professionally in the video
Let user define grid size when creating the env
Observations are too complicated, try to make them easier, the game is not that complicated to have hundreds or thousands of observations
Hard to see anythign when unit is in the city
Separate rewards for killing city and winning
make the AI to just attack everythign in sight
Try to make the environment deterministic (use the seed)

Probably I can make a HUD at the bottom, when you click on a troop it shows all info at the bottom
The troop can show general health (healthbar), but when clicked should also show the number
Do animations between moves and attacks so can tell what is going on and troops don't just magically teleport
Probably I can just use a 1D array for observations
Return unprocessed observations so the user can do whatever they want
Different Terrain
Terrain, Health, combat etc. buffs and DEBUFFS
train a model and put it as the enemy
Probably move the render functions somewhere else?
Make troop and building have the same parent class (x, y, health ,power) etc.. and then inherit
add healing when fortified
Just go through the wiki and add everything about combat 
Add unit training


LOW PRIORITY:

Package my project later

Why Box obs doesn't accept some shapes? (I guess doesn't except not perfect square)
Make the code better
a lot of the functions should be made private.

Prallelize training of model with vector env? (check how to do it)
