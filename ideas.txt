WORKING NOW:


HIGH PRIORITY:
Hard to see anythign when unit is in the city
ADD UNIT TESTS to test observation and edge cases (out of map, no moves, etc...)
The unit test should be made so that future changes don't break it (test things that should always be the same)

MEDIUM PRIORITY:

Separate rewards for killing city and winning
make the AI to just attack everythign in sight
Try to make the environment deterministic (use the seed)

Probably I can make a HUD at the bottom, when you click on a troop it shows all info at the bottom
Instead of on the troop?
The troop can show general health (healthbar), but when clicked should also show the number

Probably I can just use a 1D array for observations
Return unprocessed observations so the user can do whatever they want
Different Terrain
Terrain, Health, combat etc. buffs and DEBUFFS
train a model and put it as the enemy
Probably move the render functions somewhere else?
Make troop and building have the same parent class (x, y, health ,power) etc.. and then inherit
add healing when fortified
Just go through the wiki and add everything about combat 
Add unit training


LOW PRIORITY:

Why Box obs doesn't accept some shapes? (I guess doesn't except not perfect square)
Make the code better
a lot of the functions should be made private.

Prallelize training of model with vector env? (check how to do it)
