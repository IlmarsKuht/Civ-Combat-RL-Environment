WORKING NOW:

DO branching for the next features


HIGH PRIORITY:

ADD UNIT TESTS to test observation and edge cases (out of map, no moves, etc...)

MEDIUM PRIORITY:

observations could return a value with row and col, instead of the whole grid? could save time, becasue most of the time most of the grid will be empty

Cities also suffer and help from combat statistic (update hp power loss)
CHECK IT BECAUSE WITH CURRENT CALCULATIONS IT GETS A +10 COMBAT BONUS AT FULL HP, THAT'S STUPID

Document my code how it was documented professionally in the video
Hard to see anythign when unit is in the city
Try to make the environment deterministic (use the seed)
Probably I can make a HUD at the bottom, when you click on a troop it shows all info at the bottom
The troop can show general health (healthbar), but when clicked should also show the number
Do animations between moves and attacks so can tell what is going on and troops don't just magically teleport
Probably I can just use a 1D array for observations
Return unprocessed observations so the user can do whatever they want
Different Terrain
Terrain, Health, combat etc. buffs and DEBUFFS

Probably move the render functions somewhere else?
add healing when fortified
Just go through the wiki and add everything about combat 
Add unit training




LOW PRIORITY:

Why Box obs doesn't accept some shapes? (I guess doesn't except not perfect square)
Make the code better
a lot of the functions should be made private.

Prallelize training of model with vector env? (check how to do it)

Reward depending on damage dealt/taken?
Reward needs to be reworked (The player is punished for fortifying because there is minus reward for enemy attacking your troops, but it shouldn't be punished)
Observations are too complicated, try to make them easier, the game is not that complicated to have hundreds or thousands of observations
make the AI to just attack everythign in sight
train a model and put it as the enemy
